# RD-Subscriptions

Scripts for the [RD-Subs subscription management component for Joomla!](https://rd-media.org/joomla-subscriptions-management.html).

## Use it

Just copy the script  in the root folder of your Joomla website.  Use your FTP client to do this.

1. Get a raw version of the script : click on the raw button or go to this URL : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cavo789/rd-subs/master/Migrate_from_cbsubs.php
2. On your computer, start a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++ and copy/paste there the code
3. Save the file (if you're using Notepad++, check in the Encoding menu that you've selected UTF8 NoBom as encoding)
4. Put the saved file in your Joomla's root folder

## Run it
Start a browser and run the file i.e go to f.i. http://site/Migrate_from_cbsubs.php.   A form will be displayed, follow the instructions.

## Remarks
Be sure to check the code and verify if the logic match your needs.  I've developed the script for myself, if it can help other, it's nice. I've not covered every aspect of such migration, for sure.
